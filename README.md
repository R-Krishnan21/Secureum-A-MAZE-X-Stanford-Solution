# **Instructions** üïπÔ∏è

This Workshop consists in a series of challenges, of increasing difficulty, targetting different **concepts** and common **vulnerabilities** found in **DeFi**. The CTF is designed in different flavors for all kinds of users.

-----------------------------

## **This is the A-MAZE-X `Hardhat` flavor**

Best suited for users who are familiar with `Solidity` **and** `Javascript`.
The following setup tutorial assumes you have a recent `node.js` and `npm` installation.

### **Clone this repository**

Run the command below to clone this repository into your local machine

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:eugenioclrc/DeFi-Security-Summit-Stanford.git
cd DeFi-Security-Summit-Stanford
git checkout hardhat
```

### **Install all the project's dependencies**

Run the commands below to install all the dependencies of the A-MAZE-X `Hardhat` flavor

``` bash
npm install
```
### **Solving a challenge**

Challenge contracts are located under the `hardhat_flavor/contracts/` directory. **Do not** modify them, as it may lead to unexpected behaviors within the challenges.

To solve a challenge, you must do the following:
- Create an exploit contract(s) within the appropriate `hardhat_flavor/contracts/exploits/ExploitX.sol` file.
- Complete the necessary `JavaScript` code (in the signalized area) within the appropriate `hardhat_flavor/test/solveChallengeX.js` file.

Note that this procedure has to be done **for each challenge**.

Then, to check if the challenge has been solved, execute the following command

``` bash
npx hardhat test test/solveChallengeX.js
```

If the solution criteria have been reached, it shall display the following message

``` bash
  Solve Challenge X
    ‚úî Check if required condition has been met (XXXms)
  1 passing (XXXms)
```

Alternatively, to check if all challenges have been solved, execute the following command:

``` bash
npx hardhat test
```

which will return the test results for all challenges in order.

----------

## Important note

This set of challenges aren't set for competitive purposes. Their main objective is to showcase scenarios involving DeFi, `Solidity` concepts and common vulnerabilities.

Focus on **learning** and having **fun**! üòä
